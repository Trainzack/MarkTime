        <p>The Pep Band is a highly spirited organization that supports the athletics department and other student events at Cal Poly Pomona.
            It is comprised of diverse group of students spanning many majors who are dedicated to the quality of the music and a fun atmosphere.
            Our goal is to lend out support to our fellow Cal Poly Students by keeping spirits high in victory and in defeat.
            We are always here to show our Bronco Pride in the best way we know how: by playing music and cheering as loud as we can.
